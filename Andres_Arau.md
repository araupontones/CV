Economist with over 15 years’ experience in data science, statistical analysis and visualisation, household surveys, and Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) systems. My expertise lies on combining MEL approaches with data science tools such as online dashboards and interactive maps to enhance learning and facilitate ongoing adaptation and accountability of development programmes. By having led the design and implementation of large-scale data collection exercises internationally, I have also gained extensive expertise in project management and training of local teams. My professional experience expands over more than 41 projects across 34 countries worldwide.
